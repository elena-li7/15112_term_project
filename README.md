This project is inspired by the story of Chang’e (the Moon Goddess) and Houyi (the Archer) from Chinese mythology, as well as the novel Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan. It is said that after stealing an elixir of immortality, Chang’e was imprisoned on the Moon and left with the task of lighting candles to illuminate the Moon’s surface. Houyi, her mortal lover, was a renowned archer who protected the Earth.

Enter you, the main character. As a child of Chang’e and Houyi, you have been entrusted to light up candles on the moon while defending them from vengeful spirits. But due to your mortal body and the limitations of physics, you must monitor both your and the candles’ oxygen levels. 

The game will feature real-time, run-and-gun combat where you, an archer, fight through several Moon ‘phases.’ Use power-ups and skills to enhance your fighting abilities. There will be a main storyline with a final Boss, as well as an infinite combat game mode. There will also be several random special events (e.g. lunar eclipse, blood moon) that increase difficulty.
