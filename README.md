Moonlight Archer:
This project is inspired by the story of Chang’e (the Moon Goddess) and 
Houyi (the Archer) from Chinese mythology, as well as the novel 
Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan. It is said that after stealing an
elixir of immortality, Chang’e was imprisoned on the Moon and left with the task 
of lighting candles to illuminate the Moon’s surface. Houyi, her mortal lover, 
was a renowned archer who protected the Earth.

Enter you, the main character. As a child of Chang’e and Houyi, you have been 
entrusted to light up candles on the moon while defending them from vengeful 
spirits. But due to physical limitations, you must maintain your oxygen levels 
with randomly generated oxygen supplies.

The game features real-time combat where you, an archer, fight through 
several Moon ‘phases.’ Skills can be used to enhance your fighting abilities. 
There is a main storyline with a final Boss, as well as a random special 
event (blood moon) that increases game difficulty.

This project runs through the file 'main.py'. Please ensure that cmu_graphics is
